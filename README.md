# CSU-HeadStart
Microsoft Headstart is for customers who breathe Innovation. Tailored for startups, emerging ITeS and some selected BFSI and Mfg customers with in-house tech innovation wings, the event promises to help them explore the technologies which will build the future. 

Headstart runs on a theme of Innovating in and out exposing our customers to technologies like AI and blockchain helping them innovate their products and services in the coming time. We top this up with sessions on DevOps and Teams (showcasing use-cases from Developer ecosystem) landing a message of how these organizations can innovate the way they work! For more detailed agenda, refer to the attached invites.
